Javascript is:
    Synchronous
    Single Threaded

Execution Context:
    execute one line of code at a time
    each operation waits for the last one to complete before executing

Blocking Code vs Non Blocking Code
   Blocking code -> block the flow of program (read file sync)
   Non Blocking code -> does not block execution (read file async)

Javascript engine is made of:
    Memory heap 
    Call Stack(global execution and function execution)

The function that call web api like setTimeOut setTimeInterval --> goes to task queue --> the call Stack

The function that call web api like fetch() --> goes to promise queue --> has higher priority --> goes to call stack fast
